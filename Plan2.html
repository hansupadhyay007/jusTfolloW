                    Schedule	
  one	
  day	
  per	
  week	
  to	
  review	
  the	
  work	
  in	
  each	
  of	
  your	
  courses	
  and	
  be	
  sure	
  you	
  are	
  up-­‐to-­‐date.	
  	
  This	
  
review	
  should	
  be	
  cumulative,	
  covering	
  briefly	
  all	
  the	
  work	
  done	
  thus	
  far	
  in	
  the	
  semester.	
  	
  This	
  may	
  take	
  only	
  10	
  -­‐
20	
  minutes	
  per	
  class.	
  	
  This	
  will	
  save	
  you	
  time	
  later	
  when	
  you	
  are	
  preparing	
  for	
  tests/finals.

                        Good	
  notes	
  are	
  the

  basis	
  for	
  review.	
  Watch	
  for	
  key	
  ideas	
  in	
  lectures	
  and	
  try	
  to	
  express	
  them	
  in	
  your	
  own	
  
words	
  in	
  your	
  notes.	
  	
  Know	
  when	
  assignments	
  are	
  given	
  and	
  when	
  they	
  are	
  due.	
  	
  It	
  may	
  help	
  to	
  date	
  them	
  and	
  
number	
  the	
  pages.

                            Lack	
  of	
  flexibility	
  is	
  one	
  of	
  the	
  main	
  reasons	
  students	
  do	
  not	
  follow	
  a	
  schedule.	
  	
  Make	
  your	
  schedule	
  and	
  stick	
  to	
  
it.	
  	
  Remember	
  that	
  it	
  usually	
  takes	
  30	
  days	
  to	
  establish	
  a	
  habit.  <br>
