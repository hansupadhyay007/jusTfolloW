        <p>
            First according to your result you have to REVISE YOUR SYLLABUS atleast 1 time ONCE A WEEK. Most	
            college
            classes	
            are	
            planned	
            to	
            require	
            about	
            three	
            hours	
            work	
            per	
            week	
            per	
            credit	
            in	
            the	
            course.	
            By	
            
          multiplying	
            your	
            credit	
            load	
            by	
            three	
            you	
            can	
            get	
            a	
            good	
            idea of	
            the	
            time	
            you	
            should	
            provide	
            for	
            studying	
            in	
            
          addition	
            to	
            time	
            spent	
            in	
            class.

                    The	
  scattered	
  one	
  or	
  two	
  hour	
  free	
  periods	
  between	
  classes	
  are	
  easily	
  wasted.	
  	
  Planning	
  to	
  use	
  them	
  for	
  
studying	
  for	
  the	
  class	
  just	
  finished	
  will	
  result	
  in	
  free	
  time

  recreation	
  and	
  other	
  activities	
  at	
  other	
  times	
  in	
  the	
  
week.	
  Make	
  use	
  of	
  daylight	
  hours.	
  Research	
  shows	
  that	
  what	
  you	
  can	
  accomplish	
  in	
  one	
  hour	
  during	
  the	
  day	
  can	
  
take	
  one-­‐and-­‐a-­‐half	
  hours	
  at	
  night.	
  	
  In	
  general,	
  our	
  minds	
  and	
  bodies	
  are	
  ready	
  to	
  “wind	
  down”	
  at	
  night	
  rather	
  
than	
  “gear	
  up”	
  for	
  work.

                    Schedule	
  one	
  day	
  per	
  week	
  to	
  review	
  the	
  work	
  in	
  each	
  of	
  your	
  courses	
  and	
  be	
  sure	
  you	
  are	
  up-­‐to-­‐date.	
  	
  This	
  
review	
  should	
  be	
  cumulative,	
  covering	
  briefly	
  all	
  the	
  work	
  done	
  thus	
  far	
  in	
  the	
  semester.	
  	
  This	
  may	
  take	
  only	
  10	
  -­‐
20	
  minutes	
  per	
  class.	
  	
  This	
  will	
  save	
  you	
  time	
  later	
  when	
  you	
  are	
  preparing	
  for	
  tests/finals.

  questions

  about	
  the	
  main	
  
ideas	
  of	
  the	
  material	
  as	
  you	
  review	
  weekly.	
  	
  When	
  preparing	
  for	
  exams,	
  try	
  to	
  predict	
  the	
  questions	
  the	
  
instructor	
  may	
  ask.	
  	
  Reviewing	
  and	
  reciting	
  increase	
  memory.	
  	
  This

  save	
  time	
  in	
  the

                            Lack	
  of	
  flexibility	
  is	
  one	
  of	
  the	
  main	
  reasons	
  students	
  do	
  not	
  follow	
  a	
  schedule.	
  	
  Make	
  your	
  schedule	
  and	
  stick	
  to	
  
it.	
  	
  Remember	
  that	
  it	
  usually	
  takes	
  30	
  days	
  to	
  establish	
  a	
  habit.  <br>
